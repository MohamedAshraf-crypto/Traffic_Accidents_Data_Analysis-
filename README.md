# 🚦 Traffic Accidents Data Analysis & Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing traffic accident data** to extract meaningful insights and **building a machine learning model** to predict accident-related outcomes based on driver, vehicle, and journey attributes.

The project combines **Data Analysis**, **Business Intelligence**, and **Data Science** to provide both descriptive insights (what happened & why) and predictive capabilities (what is likely to happen).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand patterns and trends in traffic accidents
* Identify key risk factors (age, gender, location, journey purpose, etc.)
* Visualize KPIs and insights using an interactive dashboard
* Build a predictive model to estimate accident outcomes using historical data

---

## 🧠 Key Insights from the Dashboard

> ⚠️ *All percentages are based on accident records, not the total driver population.*

### 👥 Driver Demographics

* **Male Drivers:** 71.20%
* **Female Drivers:** 28.80%
* **Severe Accidents by Gender:**

  * Male: ~77.97%
  * Female: ~22.03%

### 🚗 Accidents by Driver Age

* Highest accident frequency occurs among **young and middle-aged drivers**
* Accident count decreases gradually with increasing age

### 📊 Key KPIs

* **Total Accidents:** 29.9K
* **Severe Accidents:** 11.04%
* **Average Vehicle Age:** 7.15 years

### 🛣️ Location & Journey Analysis

* Most accidents occur while:

  * Leaving main roads
  * Approaching or waiting at junctions
* **Driver Home Area Type:**

  * Urban areas account for the majority of accidents (~63%)
* **Journey Purpose:**

  * Highest accidents occur during **other/general journeys** and **work-related trips**

---

## 📈 Dashboard Features

* KPI Cards for quick insights
* Bar charts for location and journey analysis
* Donut charts for demographic distribution
* Scatter plot showing accidents by driver age
* Interactive filtering for deeper analysis

**Tools Used:**

* Power BI (Data Modeling & Visualization)

## 🤖 Data Science & Machine Learning

In addition to analysis and visualization, this project includes a **predictive modeling phase**:

### 🔍 Data Science Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection & Encoding
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

### 🧪 Model Goal

* Predict accident outcomes based on:

  * Driver characteristics
  * Vehicle information
  * Journey and location data

> The model demonstrates how historical accident data can be leveraged for **risk assessment and decision support**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
* **Power BI** (Dashboard & Reporting)
* **SQL** (Data extraction & preparation)
* **Machine Learning** (Classification models)





---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data workflow**:

* From raw data → insights → visualization → prediction

It highlights how **data analysis and machine learning** can support better understanding of traffic safety and help stakeholders make **data-driven decisions**.
